_**Doug:**_ So for this talk we got a sponsor for the talk, because Philip Zimmerman, you know, he’s used to getting talk, you know, paid for speaking engagements. So we were totally fine with that, because we wanted to get this guy on board. I tried convincing him to accept Monero, he downloaded a Cake Wallet, sent him some test Monero, we might be able to get him to put a QR show, a QR code, on the video if people want to send them tips.

Oh, here’s Mr. Zimmerman. Right now we’re trying to get you going… oh, here you go, we got it, we got you going. No we’re good, we’re good. All right, are we good? Yeah, all right. We did it guys, we did it.

So sponsored by DV Chain, they’re kind of the guys you never heard of. They’re you know but they’re very big in the crypto space, and in particular the Monero space. They’re liquidity providers, okay. So they work with exchanges, big exchanges I guess, I don’t know, Bitcoin wells and Monero wells, that need to move in and out of crypto. These guys are liquidity providers. So really interesting. I think we’re hearing from one of them later today I think, he’s gonna be on one of the panels later today right. I think we have them confirmed which is super cool, we could talk more about that. But so they agreed to sponsor this, which is really cool. Otherwise it wouldn’t be possible.

I should also say our other sponsors, because, you know, I think it’s everybody here knows who’s sponsoring the conference. But our stage sponsors are, for those listening at home, Cake Wallet and Coincads. So really big, you know, “thank you” to them, you know. Otherwise this would have been a lot more risk than it already was. So they helped us out with sponsorships and it didn’t feel as risky as an endeavor, and they’re tremendous supporters. This particular cake of the Monero community, Vic, I don’t know if he’s still here, he will be back, because we’ll be on a talk later today. Tremendous, tremendous supporters of the Monero community. So big apps to Viktor, we’ll thank him again later. And then Coincards. It’s a way to buy gift cards with Monero. A lot of the things — we bought the tent that’s outside, we bought it from home depot with the gift card, right, with Monero. These all these signs. Actually we didn’t use Coinscards for this. We convinced the guy, we bought all our signs with Monero from a local Miami guy. But what’s tremendous about them, is they’re offering a real utility and fulfilling a real need for getting into, you know, actually using your Monero.

So this talk sponsored by DV Chain. We got Phil Zimmerman. Mr. Zimmerman, do you here us?

_**Philip:**_ Hi, I’m still putting mic […]. I have a little bit distortion, right […]. So just give me a second, please. Okay, do you guys hear me?

_**Doug:**_ They hear you, we hear you. Loud and clear yeah. So Mr. Zimmerman…

_**Philip:**_ Can you hear me?

_**Doug:**_ Yes.

_**Philip:**_ Is that “yes” means that you can hear me?

_**Doug:**_ Yes, we can hear you. I guess you can’t hear you can’t hear us very well?

_**Philip:**_ Yes, there’s a lot of echo on your side.

_**Doug:**_ Okay but is it good enough, can you make it up?

_**Philip:**_ […] It is something up about the whole ambience of the audio on your side.

_**Doug:**_ Okay but at least you could hear it. Is it is it good enough?

_**Philip:**_ It’s good enough. The important question is can you hear me?

_**Doug:**_ Yes we hear you 100 percent. So I think we’re good to go. If you can quickly give an introduction of yourself, explain, you know, a little bit about your past, in particular, you know, your PGP journey.

_**Philip:**_ […] I don’t know if you’ve said enough, so I don’t say after you, you know, self-aggrandizing.

_**Doug:**_ It’s all right, I’ve been talking about you for the last half hour, trust me, trust me, before we got you up and running. So you’ve been yeah fully introduced. Go for it.

_**Philip:**_ Okay. So, yeah, I’m Phil Zimmerman and I’ve been working in this field for more than 30 years, well 35 years, although nobody knew about me before 30 years ago. And so mostly I’ve been interested in secure telephony and security email. I had to do secure email first, because the enabling technologies for security just weren’t around. Nobody had broadband for example in the early 90s. So I had to wait another decade for that to become wisely deployed. But I developed PGP, a Pretty Good Privacy, and it spread all around the world by 1991. And because of this the US government attempted to put me in prison, because at that time it was illegal to export strong encryption.

The reason why it was illegal was largely because of the events of the 20th century, where World War II was highly affected by crypto analysis. The allies wrote the German decrypting code, and the Japanese, and they shortened the war in a couple of years saving millions of lives. And so the governments, especially the allied powers, recognized that having the ability to crypto analyze the enemy’s communications was so important that they made it illegal to export strong encryption.

But fast forward to the 1990s, and the internet was here, and the internet meant that everybody needed strong encryption to use, how could they do confidence, how could they do as they moved their lives more and more into the realm of you know the internet. We couldn’t, we had a natural right to privacy that came from millions of years of face-to-face conversations. And it was a right to a private conversation, it was not so much enforced by law, but rather enforced by the laws of physics. So if you wanted to speak to somebody face to face, you can just do that with enough separation from other people, that no one else can hear you speaking except the person in front of you.

And so that’s the way in which we evolved, and that’s the expectations that we had, you know, by our physical experience. And so if we wanted to preserve that, even after the arrival of communications technology, then we would have to use encryption. So with the invention of the telephone within a century ago and the telegraph, you know, we needed to have encryption. And that’s in World War II was highly influenced by a radio communication, and they had to have encryption for military communication for real. So this is what shaped, you know, the outcome of the war, and this is a so many of the, you know, the World War II allies the expectation that they had to regulate strong encryption.

But with the arrival of the internet everyone else needed to have strong encryption, and that’s why we spent the entire decade of the 1990s in a kind of a global struggle to change the laws to allow us to export strong encryption. Some countries even had the best controls than US and just export goals, but the French had domestic controls, and the British had a little bit of controls, and also in the US even though they didn’t have domestic controls there was an effort by the FBI to impose domestic controls. That was in the form of the clipper chip, perhaps some of you might have heard of that. They wanted to put this special chip in every phone that could encrypt your conversation, but the chips were manufactured by well essentially the government. And they had a unique key placed in each chip, and they had a vast database of these keys under the control of the government that they could use for wiretap purposes. And much to the surprise of the FBI the invisible hand of the free market did not favor the clipper chip. Nobody wanted to buy phones with that clipper chip. Surprise, surprise! They couldn’t even imagine that people were not interested encrypted sim-card […]

_**Doug:**_ Mr. Zimmerman, I just want to ask a question here, just because I want everybody to have opportunities to ask you as well.

_**Philip:**_ Yeah, I’ll answer the questions of the community. I just want to close here, to do it in the preorder.

_**Doug:**_ Please do.

_**Philip:**_ So we had to fight the whole decade to make this happen. […] The government tried to put me in prison for this, for PGP. And we finally managed to prevail in that, without getting break. But it still took several more years to change the laws, and they were changed in 2000. After that we built up a technology infrastructure around the world that had strong encryption ubiquitous. It was everywhere — in the browsers it was, you know, in all this encryption it was in the Tor network, it was, you know, in all kinds of technologies that have embedded strong encryption, and it’s been growing that way for the past 20 years.

And so but now we’re seeing governments push back and they’ll say, well, they might have make it illegal to do head-to-head encryption again. I think it’s, you know, we’re gonna have to both lives to push back against that, especially with democracy is collapsing all over the world. Democracies are under attack and becoming autocracies. We see it in Hungary, in Victor Orban’s Hungary, to a lesser extent in Poland, but they’re moving in the same direction, in Brazil, you know, in the US we see it happening, and lots of governments around the world that were liberal democracies are becoming populist autocracies. And if we allow back doors in our encryption for in a world where we’re losing our democracies, we’re never going to be able to organize politically to resist a autocracies’ rule. And then, you know, we won’t get the political traction. You see this in China — it’s a surveillance state, and there’s no meaningful political opposition. So the stakes are very high. We have to have strong encryption.

_**Doug:**_ So well, yes.

_**Philip:**_ […]

_**Doug:**_ So well, so well stated. I hope you could hear me. That was amazing, the way you put it.

_**Philip:**_ I can’t really hear you.

_**Doug:**_ Okay, okay. First question. Can you hear me better like this?

_**Philip:**_ Yeah, that’s actually much more clear

_**Doug:**_ All right, good job.

_[No sound 12:22 – 20:55]_

_**Philip:**_ …I have to call a PSDN number […] That’s not any critical. […] But, you know, sometimes I am interested in protecting myself, in the place where I am, if I visit the Ukraine, for example. And I call a PSDN number in North America. Then if the PSDN gateway is far away from the place, that maybe that’s good enough, because the real threat is nearby, if the Russians are intercepting.

_**Doug:**_ Maybe we have a question. Do you draw a distinction that between preserving the ability to communicate through speech using encryption that perhaps governments don’t have the ability to surveil or spy or anyway, the distinction between that and digital cash? Do you think digital cash should be as free and uninhibited as speech communication through the internet? Do you draw a distinction because of the reasons you are saying such as sanctions?

_**Philip:**_ Well, I haven’t seen a good design for this cryptocurrency yet that addresses all these problems. I would like to see a design with a smaller footprint, that’s still as secure as the personal network. And I don’t want to, you know, I don’t know how to do that, maybe it’s something, maybe personal network with zero proof will do that. And I also would like to see, well, I you know, I’d like to be able to spend money personally as individuals and have preserved personal privacy, but to have nation states being able to spend money, nation space spend money. And I don’t really feel like a great need to protect the privacy of our nation states for money. Well maybe for some classified, you know, expenditures, for the military or something, but nation states generally, I don’t want them to evade sanctions. So if we had a cryptocurrency that was somehow, it’s kind of like a low-pass filter, you know, where smaller transactions that humans, actual humans, might use that maybe need privacy preserving. But large billion dollar transactions that, you know, that nation states might use, would not have the same anonymity for sanctions evading purposes. Now as I  know we don’t have a cryptocurrency like that right now, but I think it would be interesting to see if it’s possible to design something like that. I’m so horrified about what’s happening in Ukraine. You know, the war crimes, the horrible, horrible atrocities that I really very, very interested in sanctions. And so, you know, that’s on my mind when I look at cryptocurrency, I think that […] all these years we have to cope with some anonymity network having privacy preserving features for natural people, humans, but not for nation states.

_**Audience:**_ Yeah, okay, thanks. I’m just coming. I just had a question, do you mind, just going into a little bit about the process of publishing PGP, and just really what that was like,, and where did that idea really come from? […]

_**Philip:**_ Well, it’s quite a weird story. I wanted to do something along those lines going all the way back to the 1980s. […] So I was using my skills and the experience to protect my grassroots political organizations and human rights for them, to protect their communications. And so I didn’t really have time to do teaching people, it was in 1980s. But I did it in the 90s. And I did it when internet started to progress. […] And my motivation was… I doubted that smartphone can . And I started working on it took me about six months to get the first… so the question was this gentleman was asking basically what inspired him to equate code to speech and then pursue that as a legal argument right essentially what the question was and so he’s telling the story as to why he went down that path but let them okay my feeling about protecting the privacy of our speech I felt my natural sort of instincts about speech was how we evolved you know for as long as humans have had a speech for you know the past million years that we’ve always enjoyed the ability to have private speech private conversations you know if you wanted to have a private conversation you didn’t need to has any kind of technology for that you could just go talk to somebody because you know if you don’t actually listen you know because you know 200 years ago more than certainly well over 200 years ago then there was no technology that you know speech wasn’t driven by technology speech was just naturally between events and so they actually already enjoyed in their speech it was built in it was built into the physics of how humans talk to each other there was no need to codify it in the constitution because electronic communications about a century ago with you know the invention of the telephone especially that the need for recognizing the need for privacy in our stage you know became important because you know it was also required there was no way to secretly listen to our conversations before the mediation of electronic communication technology because if you saw anyone listening to you see them standing right here and you could say we’re going to go over here and have a conversation further away where nobody was curious and so that’s what I wanted to preserve I felt that we already had that before these advances in technology to get away from us so I wanted to restore that just thinking about male you know you know we all use paper envelopes it was very labor intensive too you couldn’t intercept everyone's mail pass you know it was impossible you know all at once and so that meant that they believed whether or not it seemed worthwhile they had probable cause to investigate somebody my own during my criminal investigation and so you know I didn’t like that but if they if they have to decide and they take it to a court you know and they have to do a whole lot of work the labor you know introduces friction and that makes a that makes a qualitative difference because I mean look okay look at spam okay why do we have so much spam back in the days of postal mail remember that postal mail we have spam but not very much we had what 10 pieces of spam every day at this peak no more than that because why because it costs money to buy postage stamps to put on the staff and so anybody who wants to send spam and postal they’ll have to spend money to do it the reason why we have a thousand spam messages in our inbox every day is because it costs nothing so when you when you eliminate your friction it causes a qualitative change and the same is true if you can have effortless interception of mail if you can scan mail automatically for keywords or even recognizing the you know sentence structure and what it means the semantic meaning and you can do the same thing with phone calls you know then it becomes too easy for prosecutors in fact artificial intelligence makes it possible that a prosecutor for you know an autocratic government say here automatically intercept all the communications of everybody in this opposition party and see if any of them are breaking the law and then we can go arrest them and you can do that in an automated fashion and that that changes everything so what I would like to do is to prevent massive large-scale surveillance surveillance at scale I would like to prevent that and encryption does a good job with that amazing so guys any questions go ahead thanks Mr. Zimmerman may I call you Phil Hi I’m Chad Phil I was wondering uh given all of the trucks that are needed to haul around dollar bills and coins all of the security people all of the bank computers and the federal networks and all the rest of the stuff the enforcement all the time spent in court dealing with all of this stuff all of the everything involved there’s the military spends a lot of time on enforcing it can you compare do you do what do you think would be a reasonable comparison of the carbon footprint of the US dollar to a worst-case scenario of Bitcoin’s proof of work keeping in mind I think is probably considerably lower given its limited um it’s limited economics and scale for mining by large right right there is a smaller problem right comparing about the carbon footprint right but comparing Bitcoin to us dollars do you have a sense of how those things might compare in the future in your in your let’s just say you have a crystal ball what do you think well you know I heard you say you know the cost of the military but I think the military does a lot of things for us besides and they know how money gets moved around the military also protects us from Russian tanks yeah let’s just take the piece of the military that helps in enforce the US dollar relevance and things like the petrodollar and all the rest of the stuff that that’s done because a lot frankly a lot of enforcement like worldwide enforcement of the US dollar does fall to the military and obviously that’s not the lion’s share of the military itself yeah I don’t think of the I don’t think that the US military is largely oriented toward enforcing the attractiveness of the US dollar I think of that our use of military over the last century has been you know largely about the you know we had a kind of an empire in the 20th century yeah especially during the cold war after World War II and we did a lot of bad things with the military back there and now after the cold war our military tended to be used more for things that are more good like delivering food to Somalia or something like that right now it’s helping the Ukrainians protect themselves and so I see the military you know in mixed ways it depends on what they’re told to do they’re told to do bad things I don’t like them but if they’re if they’re you know doing things that I that I want them to do then that’s good for all of us that you know that I do like what they’re doing so I it you know I tend to look at as I said it’s like this you know these technologies have mixed effects and the military also new suspects it’s not so much the fault of the military it’s the policies that assign the military to go and do things to fight wars but maybe we shouldn’t be fighting like Vietnam or you know the wars against in Central America you know there would be military hunters that were kept in power by US military back that was during I you know I think I’ve gone off on too many tangents here but what I’m trying to say is that I see your military in different contexts and so some of it’s good and some of it’s not well right now the thing that’s on my mind the most right now I’ve lived in Europe and I had I’ve been to Ukraine many many times and I’ve been all over the Ukraine and it’s not they don’t call it the Ukraine because that sounds like a region instead of a country it’s Ukraine and I had engineers working for me in Ukraine I went there many times to write an engineering process and I see what’s happening here and it’s absolutely horrifying and it’s the most important thing that’s happened since World War II and I think that we should we need to stop them we need to stop the Russians in Ukraine and if we don’t what’s to stop I mean it’s tyranny I mean everybody’s worried about everybody in the cryptocurrency world worries about tyranny well done this is the worst type of tyranny it’s mass murder on an industrial scale okay just a quick redirect on that wow I sound like a lawyer please shoot me the I guess what I was actually aiming for was more your thoughts on the balance of cryptocurrency versus US dollar in terms of carbon footprint yeah I think you were trying to trying to compare the efficiency and energies and yeah I went off on this tangent I’m sorry I don’t I’m too often tempted by tangents  I do that well thank you I think that you know if you compare the energy usage with uh say Visa Mastercard I mean it’s thousands of times more energy intense per transaction at least Bitcoin is and so you know I just think that you know I think there is a way it could be done I mean for example imagine that you had a rooftop solar panel on your home and you had one of these Tesla power walls right and the rooftop solar charges the power wall battery you know and then you can sell that power later when there’s more demand for it well what if the power wall is full there’s you can’t charge it anymore it’s at maximum and the price of electricity at that moment in the day which fluctuates according to demand there’s no demand for it and the price you know you can’t sell that electricity to anyone in that case use it to mine Bitcoin or whatever your you know or Monero or whatever you want to buy because that energy is wasted you know it can’t go anywhere you can’t store it and you can’t sell it to anywhere else so in that case why not you know why not do some uh cryptocurrency mining right on the spot that would be wonderful that would take away all of my objections on the climate change aspects of this thank you very much and uh thank you for PGP it’s a great gift to humanity I still use it to this day thank you for your contributions if you have a possibility go ahead you want to come up I’m dying to ask a question so thank you thank you very much Mr. Zimmerman by the way kind of continuing some of your thoughts about the sanctions and whatnot it’s more of more of a comment slash critique what is the difference if right now we see a huge marriage between a lot of governments that are becoming autocratic and most many of them are in the west and supposed to be the proponents of liberal democracy but we see a marriage of them and big tech and so we see the way technology can be used the way a lot of these groups can be co-opted by government and whatnot what is the difference of that and what you were seeming to propose a sort of role of encryption and PGP and crypto in creating sec or helping countries to avoid sanctions is there not there also a danger if there’s not certain parameters in place trying to of basically trying to create a system where those same autocratic entities could step in and use or co-op that means for basically their own justifying their own policies or implementing their own policies towards one nation therefore disfavoring other nations because the reason we see a lot of fomo right now in other countries towards adopting Bitcoin as a sort of hedge against inflation is because of what's happening in Ukraine with Russia by putting these sanctions on Russia because we all know the world bank and imf will not they basically run the show in terms of everybody’s reserve currency you know every most most countries have their reserve currency in USD so everybody everybody’s looking for an option is BTC I’m gonna fill that void you seem to be proposing a sort of alternative to BTC because of its deficiencies that would allow for such a system to be in place that is allow a governance to prevent the evasion of you know of sanctions so it’s very difficult I hope I didn’t you know confuse you more but yeah I  just want to say this is very difficult I’m not gonna be honest and so I’m a little bit handicapped here I could try to speculate on things but I don’t have enough core expertise on you know on the macro effects of trying to have you know exactly how you design cryptocurrency that meets all the needs I don’t know I think it would be worth putting a lot of smart people together and you know um people would Mr. Zipper I just wanted just to boil this question down too so do you on a philosophical level do you do you how do you measure the two right so digital cash can be used to avoid sanctions potentially but it could also be used like you're saying by you know political minorities to make sure tyranny doesn’t preserve in that way why are you giving more weight towards the ability to sanction versus the weight of the ability to freely transact and give political minorities the ability to prevent tyranny through that form why don’t aren’t you considering them equal equally important one or perhaps I would very much like to have a cryptocurrency that preserves personal privacy and how people spend money you know I think that you know before we started using credit cards people generally bought things with cash I sometimes you would write a check but mostly that was that was too slow so people walked into somewhere and with cash in their pocket and they walked out with boots last question do you think digital cash is ultimately inevitable so we’re talking about you know what it means for society the pros and the cons but as a technology uh a decentralized digital cash do you think it’s adoption is inevitable or do you think it could be co-opted essentially at the end of the day by the state or some tyranny well certainly large states are trying to do that I mean china is frightened and you know I mean Russia has tried to do that you know autocracies are trying to do that at least some of them aren’t you know they want to make their own state currency that way and I don’t know that doesn’t seem to bring any privacy they’re not designed for privacy they’re in fact they’re designed so that they can tell what everybody’s doing right right it’s worse than credit cards well we greatly appreciate you and this actually worked out really well I think we were able to hear you and for the most part you're able to hear us thank you so much can we pay you for the speaker fee in Monero no you don’t have to ask the answer okay all right guys we have another talk coming up but it’s going to be similar inside a lot of questions here is so give us like two minutes all right thank you so much

_[Applause]_
